    <description>Dart Editor is an open-source tool for editing, debugging, and running Dart applications.

Dart is a new web programming language with libraries, a virtual machine, and tools. Dart helps developers build structured modern web apps. Dart compiles to JavaScript to run across the entire modern web.

* The Dart language is familiar and easy to learn. It's class based and object oriented, without being dogmatic.
* The Pub package manager makes getting and sharing libraries easy.
* Core libraries provide all the basics, including support for asynchronous programming with Futures.
* Performance is good and getting better. Dart apps are fastest in the Dart VM, but they can be speedy even after compilation to JavaScript.
* Web UI lets you use future web APIs today, with support for proposed standards such as web components, MDV, and shadow DOM.
* All modern browsers (both desktop and mobile) can run Dart web apps, thanks to our Dart-to-JavaScript compiler.
