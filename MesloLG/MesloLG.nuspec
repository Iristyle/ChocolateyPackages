    <title>Meslo LG Monospaced Programming Font with dotted zeros</title>

    <summary>Customized version of Apple's Menlo font. Great monospaced font for development work. Should also work with the Windows Console.</summary>
    <description>Meslo LG is a customized version of Apple’s Menlo-Regular font
(which is a customized Bitstream Vera Sans Mono).

    In Snow Leopard, Menlo-Regular is now the preferred and default font for Apple’s 
    developer tools and also the Terminal (unless you changed the font settings for 
    these apps yourself before upgrading to SL – your changes will stay in place).

    I really like Menlo but I do have my nitpicky gripes with it:

    * The default vertical (line) spacing is just way to cramped for me, and also
    * I am not particularily fond of the horizontal baseline alignment of the asterisk.

    <releaseNotes>v0.1

    Initial release.

    v1.0

    Meslo has changed it’s name to Meslo LG which now includes three variants: 
    small, medium and large.

    LG stands for Line Gap, so there’s one variant for smaller vertical line spacing, 
    more towards Apple’s Menlo, a normal line gap (which equals Meslo v0.1) and 
    a large gap, which is more than twice the space of Apple’s Menlo.

    In addition to Regular, there’s Italic, Bold and Bold Italic font styles 
    included for each LG variant.

    Tweaked the ascender/descender/line gap relationship a bit for better layout 
    at marginal smaller font sizes and prominent font styles (such as Bold and 
    Bold Italic). Things line underlines should be better to perceive now for 
    the font styles.

    The asterisk (*) was tweaked for all font styles. 
    This includes making it line up with all alignment zones for similar height 
    symbol characters and fixing Menlo’s absence of a slanting angle for the italic 
    and bold italic font styles while maintaining the readability at all sizes.

    v1.0

    Added a dotted zero version of Meslo LG which is called Meslo LG DZ.</releaseNotes>
