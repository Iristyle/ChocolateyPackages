    <summary>Open Source SSL v2/v3 and TLS v1 toolkit</summary>
    <description>This is really 1.0.1j, but the Nuget spec doesn't allow such version identifiers, so the file versions are used.

    The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a full-strength general purpose cryptography library. The project is managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related documentation.

    The Win32 OpenSSL Installation Project is dedicated to providing a simple installation of OpenSSL. It is easy to set up and easy to use through the simple, effective installer. No need to compile anything or jump through any hoops, just click a few times and it is installed, leaving you to doing real work. Download it today! Note that these are default builds of OpenSSL and subject to local and state laws. More information can be found in the legal agreement of the installation.

  Changes between 1.0.1i and 1.0.1j [15 Oct 2014]

    *) SRTP Memory Leak.

       A flaw in the DTLS SRTP extension parsing code allows an attacker, who
       sends a carefully crafted handshake message, to cause OpenSSL to fail
       to free up to 64k of memory causing a memory leak. This could be
       exploited in a Denial Of Service attack. This issue affects OpenSSL
       1.0.1 server implementations for both SSL/TLS and DTLS regardless of
       whether SRTP is used or configured. Implementations of OpenSSL that
       have been compiled with OPENSSL_NO_SRTP defined are not affected.

       The fix was developed by the OpenSSL team.
       (CVE-2014-3513)
       [OpenSSL team]

    *) Session Ticket Memory Leak.

       When an OpenSSL SSL/TLS/DTLS server receives a session ticket the
       integrity of that ticket is first verified. In the event of a session
       ticket integrity check failing, OpenSSL will fail to free memory
       causing a memory leak. By sending a large number of invalid session
       tickets an attacker could exploit this issue in a Denial Of Service
       attack.
       (CVE-2014-3567)
       [Steve Henson]

    *) Build option no-ssl3 is incomplete.

       When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers
       could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
       configured to send them.
       (CVE-2014-3568)
       [Akamai and the OpenSSL team]

    *) Add support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV.
       Client applications doing fallback retries should call
       SSL_set_mode(s, SSL_MODE_SEND_FALLBACK_SCSV).
       (CVE-2014-3566)
       [Adam Langley, Bodo Moeller]

    *) Add additional DigestInfo checks.

       Reencode DigestInto in DER and check against the original when
       verifying RSA signature: this will reject any improperly encoded
       DigestInfo structures.

       Note: this is a precautionary measure and no attacks are currently known.

       [Steve Henson]

   Changes between 1.0.1h and 1.0.1i [6 Aug 2014]

    *) Fix SRP buffer overrun vulnerability. Invalid parameters passed to the
       SRP code can be overrun an internal buffer. Add sanity check that
       g, A, B &lt; N to SRP code.

       Thanks to Sean Devlin and Watson Ladd of Cryptography Services, NCC
       Group for discovering this issue.
       (CVE-2014-3512)
       [Steve Henson]

    *) A flaw in the OpenSSL SSL/TLS server code causes the server to negotiate
       TLS 1.0 instead of higher protocol versions when the ClientHello message
       is badly fragmented. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to force a
       downgrade to TLS 1.0 even if both the server and the client support a
       higher protocol version, by modifying the client's TLS records.

       Thanks to David Benjamin and Adam Langley (Google) for discovering and
       researching this issue.
       (CVE-2014-3511)
       [David Benjamin]

    *) OpenSSL DTLS clients enabling anonymous (EC)DH ciphersuites are subject
       to a denial of service attack. A malicious server can crash the client
       with a null pointer dereference (read) by specifying an anonymous (EC)DH
       ciphersuite and sending carefully crafted handshake messages.

       Thanks to Felix Gr�bert (Google) for discovering and researching this
       issue.
       (CVE-2014-3510)
       [Emilia K�sper]

    *) By sending carefully crafted DTLS packets an attacker could cause openssl
       to leak memory. This can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.
       Thanks to Adam Langley for discovering and researching this issue.
       (CVE-2014-3507)
       [Adam Langley]

    *) An attacker can force openssl to consume large amounts of memory whilst
       processing DTLS handshake messages. This can be exploited through a
       Denial of Service attack.
       Thanks to Adam Langley for discovering and researching this issue.
       (CVE-2014-3506)
       [Adam Langley]

    *) An attacker can force an error condition which causes openssl to crash
       whilst processing DTLS packets due to memory being freed twice. This
       can be exploited through a Denial of Service attack.
       Thanks to Adam Langley and Wan-Teh Chang for discovering and researching
       this issue.
       (CVE-2014-3505)
       [Adam Langley]

    *) If a multithreaded client connects to a malicious server using a resumed
       session and the server sends an ec point format extension it could write
       up to 255 bytes to freed memory.

       Thanks to Gabor Tyukasz (LogMeIn Inc) for discovering and researching this
       issue.
       (CVE-2014-3509)
       [Gabor Tyukasz]

    *) A malicious server can crash an OpenSSL client with a null pointer
       dereference (read) by specifying an SRP ciphersuite even though it was not
       properly negotiated with the client. This can be exploited through a
       Denial of Service attack.

       Thanks to Joonas Kuorilehto and Riku Hietam�ki (Codenomicon) for
       discovering and researching this issue.
       (CVE-2014-5139)
       [Steve Henson]

    *) A flaw in OBJ_obj2txt may cause pretty printing functions such as
       X509_name_oneline, X509_name_print_ex et al. to leak some information
       from the stack. Applications may be affected if they echo pretty printing
       output to the attacker.

       Thanks to Ivan Fratric (Google) for discovering this issue.
       (CVE-2014-3508)
       [Emilia K�sper, and Steve Henson]

    *) Fix ec_GFp_simple_points_make_affine (thus, EC_POINTs_mul etc.)
       for corner cases. (Certain input points at infinity could lead to
       bogus results, with non-infinity inputs mapped to infinity too.)
       [Bodo Moeller]

 Changes between 1.0.1g and 1.0.1h [5 Jun 2014]

  *) Fix for SSL/TLS MITM flaw. An attacker using a carefully crafted
     handshake can force the use of weak keying material in OpenSSL
     SSL/TLS clients and servers.

     Thanks to KIKUCHI Masashi (Lepidum Co. Ltd.) for discovering and
     researching this issue. (CVE-2014-0224)
     [KIKUCHI Masashi, Steve Henson]

  *) Fix DTLS recursion flaw. By sending an invalid DTLS handshake to an
     OpenSSL DTLS client the code can be made to recurse eventually crashing
     in a DoS attack.

     Thanks to Imre Rad (Search-Lab Ltd.) for discovering this issue.
     (CVE-2014-0221)
     [Imre Rad, Steve Henson]

  *) Fix DTLS invalid fragment vulnerability. A buffer overrun attack can
     be triggered by sending invalid DTLS fragments to an OpenSSL DTLS
     client or server. This is potentially exploitable to run arbitrary
     code on a vulnerable client or server.

     Thanks to J�ri Aedla for reporting this issue. (CVE-2014-0195)
     [J�ri Aedla, Steve Henson]

  *) Fix bug in TLS code where clients enable anonymous ECDH ciphersuites
     are subject to a denial of service attack.

     Thanks to Felix Gr�bert and Ivan Fratric at Google for discovering
     this issue. (CVE-2014-3470)
     [Felix Gr�bert, Ivan Fratric, Steve Henson]

  *) Harmonize version and its documentation. -f flag is used to display
     compilation flags.
     [mancha (mancha1@zoho.com)]

  *) Fix eckey_priv_encode so it immediately returns an error upon a failure
     in i2d_ECPrivateKey.
     [mancha (mancha1@zoho.com)]

  *) Fix some double frees. These are not thought to be exploitable.
     [mancha (mancha1@zoho.com)]

 Changes between 1.0.1f and 1.0.1g [7 Apr 2014]

  *) A missing bounds check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension
     can be used to reveal up to 64k of memory to a connected client or
     server.

     Thanks for Neel Mehta of Google Security for discovering this bug and to
     Adam Langley (agl@chromium.org) and Bodo Moeller (bmoeller@acm.org) for
     preparing the fix (CVE-2014-0160)
     [Adam Langley, Bodo Moeller]

  *) Fix for the attack described in the paper "Recovering OpenSSL
     ECDSA Nonces Using the FLUSH+RELOAD Cache Side-channel Attack"
     by Yuval Yarom and Naomi Benger. Details can be obtained from:
     http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/140

     Thanks to Yuval Yarom and Naomi Benger for discovering this
     flaw and to Yuval Yarom for supplying a fix (CVE-2014-0076)
     [Yuval Yarom and Naomi Benger]

  *) TLS pad extension: draft-agl-tls-padding-03

     Workaround for the "TLS hang bug" (see FAQ and PR#2771): if the
     TLS client Hello record length value would otherwise be > 255 and
     less that 512 pad with a dummy extension containing zeroes so it
     is at least 512 bytes long.

     [Adam Langley, Steve Henson]

 Changes between 1.0.1e and 1.0.1f [6 Jan 2014]

  *) Fix for TLS record tampering bug. A carefully crafted invalid
     handshake could crash OpenSSL with a NULL pointer exception.
     Thanks to Anton Johansson for reporting this issues.
     (CVE-2013-4353)

  *) Keep original DTLS digest and encryption contexts in retransmission
     structures so we can use the previous session parameters if they need
     to be resent. (CVE-2013-6450)
     [Steve Henson]

  *) Add option SSL_OP_SAFARI_ECDHE_ECDSA_BUG (part of SSL_OP_ALL) which
     avoids preferring ECDHE-ECDSA ciphers when the client appears to be
     Safari on OS X.  Safari on OS X 10.8..10.8.3 advertises support for
     several ECDHE-ECDSA ciphers, but fails to negotiate them.  The bug
     is fixed in OS X 10.8.4, but Apple have ruled out both hot fixing
     10.8..10.8.3 and forcing users to upgrade to 10.8.4 or newer.
     [Rob Stradling, Adam Langley]

 Changes between 1.0.1d and 1.0.1e [11 Feb 2013]

  *) Correct fix for CVE-2013-0169. The original didn't work on AES-NI
     supporting platforms or when small records were transferred.
     [Andy Polyakov, Steve Henson]

 Changes between 1.0.1c and 1.0.1d [5 Feb 2013]

  *) Make the decoding of SSLv3, TLS and DTLS CBC records constant time.

     This addresses the flaw in CBC record processing discovered by
     Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson. Details of this attack can be found
     at: http://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/tls/

     Thanks go to Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson of the Information
     Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London
     (www.isg.rhul.ac.uk) for discovering this flaw and Adam Langley and
     Emilia K�sper for the initial patch.
     (CVE-2013-0169)
     [Emilia K�sper, Adam Langley, Ben Laurie, Andy Polyakov, Steve Henson]

  *) Fix flaw in AESNI handling of TLS 1.2 and 1.1 records for CBC mode
     ciphersuites which can be exploited in a denial of service attack.
     Thanks go to and to Adam Langley (agl@chromium.org) for discovering
     and detecting this bug and to Wolfgang Ettlinger
     (wolfgang.ettlinger@gmail.com) for independently discovering this issue.
     (CVE-2012-2686)
     [Adam Langley]

  *) Return an error when checking OCSP signatures when key is NULL.
     This fixes a DoS attack. (CVE-2013-0166)
     [Steve Henson]

  *) Make openssl verify return errors.
     [Chris Palmer (palmer@google.com) and Ben Laurie]

  *) Call OCSP Stapling callback after ciphersuite has been chosen, so
     the right response is stapled. Also change SSL_get_certificate()
     so it returns the certificate actually sent.
     See http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=2836.
     [Rob Stradling (rob.stradling@comodo.com)]

  *) Fix possible deadlock when decoding public keys.
     [Steve Henson]

  *) Don't use TLS 1.0 record version number in initial client hello
     if renegotiating.
     [Steve Henson]

 Changes between 1.0.1b and 1.0.1c [10 May 2012]

  *) Sanity check record length before skipping explicit IV in TLS
     1.2, 1.1 and DTLS to avoid DoS attack.

     Thanks to Codenomicon for discovering this issue using Fuzz-o-Matic
     fuzzing as a service testing platform.
     (CVE-2012-2333)
     [Steve Henson]

  *) Initialise tkeylen properly when encrypting CMS messages.
     Thanks to Solar Designer of Openwall for reporting this issue.
     [Steve Henson]

  *) In FIPS mode don't try to use composite ciphers as they are not
     approved.
     [Steve Henson]

 Changes between 1.0.1a and 1.0.1b [26 Apr 2012]

  *) OpenSSL 1.0.0 sets SSL_OP_ALL to 0x80000FFFL and OpenSSL 1.0.1 and
     1.0.1a set SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1 to 0x00000400L which would unfortunately
     mean any application compiled against OpenSSL 1.0.0 headers setting
     SSL_OP_ALL would also set SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1, unintentionally disablng
     TLS 1.1 also. Fix this by changing the value of SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1 to
     0x10000000L Any application which was previously compiled against
     OpenSSL 1.0.1 or 1.0.1a headers and which cares about SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1_1
     will need to be recompiled as a result. Letting be results in
     inability to disable specifically TLS 1.1 and in client context,
     in unlike event, limit maximum offered version to TLS 1.0 [see below].
     [Steve Henson]

  *) In order to ensure interoperabilty SSL_OP_NO_protocolX does not
     disable just protocol X, but all protocols above X *if* there are
     protocols *below* X still enabled. In more practical terms it means
     that if application wants to disable TLS1.0 in favor of TLS1.1 and
     above, it's not sufficient to pass SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1, one has to pass
     SSL_OP_NO_TLSv1|SSL_OP_NO_SSLv3|SSL_OP_NO_SSLv2. This applies to
     client side.
     [Andy Polyakov]

 Changes between 1.0.1 and 1.0.1a [19 Apr 2012]

  *) Check for potentially exploitable overflows in asn1_d2i_read_bio
     BUF_mem_grow and BUF_mem_grow_clean. Refuse attempts to shrink buffer
     in CRYPTO_realloc_clean.

     Thanks to Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team, for discovering this
     issue and to Adam Langley &lt;agl@chromium.org&gt; for fixing it.
     (CVE-2012-2110)
     [Adam Langley (Google), Tavis Ormandy, Google Security Team]

  *) Don't allow TLS 1.2 SHA-256 ciphersuites in TLS 1.0, 1.1 connections.
     [Adam Langley]

  *) Workarounds for some broken servers that "hang" if a client hello
     record length exceeds 255 bytes:

     1. Do not use record version number > TLS 1.0 in initial client
        hello: some (but not all) hanging servers will now work.
     2. If we set OPENSSL_MAX_TLS1_2_CIPHER_LENGTH this will truncate
        the number of ciphers sent in the client hello. This should be
        set to an even number, such as 50, for example by passing:
        -DOPENSSL_MAX_TLS1_2_CIPHER_LENGTH=50 to config or Configure.
        Most broken servers should now work.
     3. If all else fails setting OPENSSL_NO_TLS1_2_CLIENT will disable
        TLS 1.2 client support entirely.
     [Steve Henson]

  *) Fix SEGV in Vector Permutation AES module observed in OpenSSH.
